Homework
--------

Q. What did you learn from the histogram that wasn't apparent from the box plot?

A. You can see more clearly that the distribution is skewed with a long tail to the right.
You can also see that there are more incidences of funding at the 5000-10000-15000-etc.
marks and that the numbers drop off after those peaks.

Q. What information from the box plot isn't readily apparent in the histogram?

A. You can see more clearly where the median is. You can also make out the
25th and 75th quantiles clearly.

Q. Be able to describe the result and how it compares with the values from the "Amount.Funded.By.Investors".

A. "Amount.Funded.By.Investors" is generally less than "Amount.Requested" but not always. See last graph.
